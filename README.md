# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Linear Regression

This Python script analyzes COVID-19 data in India using Pandas and performs a simple linear regression using scikit-learn to predict the number of confirmed cases based on the number of cured and deceased cases. Additionally, it provides a mean squared error as a measure of the model's performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Pandas
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
